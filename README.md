# braille-translation
Braille is a writing system used to read by touch instead of sight. Each character is composed of six dots in a 2x3 grid, where each dot can either  be a bump or be flat (no bump). This contains a function answer(plaintext) that  takes a string parameter and returns a string of 1's and 0's representing the bumps and the absence of bumps in the input string. The function encodes the 26 lowercase letters, handles capitalization by adding a Braille capitalization mark before that character, and uses a blank character (000000) for spaces. Strings are less than fifty characters long and contain only letters and spaces.
